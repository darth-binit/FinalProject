# FinalProject
This is our Git repo for the Machine Learning Final Project. Here we will be our work relating to Skin disease Multimodal (CNN + Attention) followed by Classifier. 

So far we have concluded our data preprocessing and are now starting EDA. Since our Data is imbalanced with 8 classes, we need to take care of those. One of our member have started our Model building and currently working on Channel attention where as other member are working on image augmentation, oversampling etc to balance the data simultaneously.
